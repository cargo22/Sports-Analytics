    "When talking about the many great UCL runs seen in my lifetime, I always remember Real Madrid's 21/22 campaign. I was a senior in high school- the end of the school year was upon us, the senioritis was kicking in, and my friend and I would constantly talk about the 'black magic rituals' Real Madrid was performing to pull off these miracles. I vividly remember watching the second leg of Real Madrid vs Man City, where my friend and I were in class, trying our hardest to not cause commotion in the middle of lecture. We were close to screaming, but opted to not create a scene. As a lifelong Barcelona fan, it was definitely hard to watch, but all I could do was admire the gift the footballing gods provided us. Thus, I want to revisit this campaign and truly point out how miraculous this season was."

    "Now, for the sake of simplicity, I'm only going to analyze the knockout stages. Not much happened in the group stage. However, as a Barca fan, I most definitely enjoyed watching them lose to Sheriff. I will always remember that. Now, let's get into the juicy stuff."
